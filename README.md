# PostFixEvaluator
C++ Program designed to run in the LINUX terminal that evaluates postfix expressions from a text file. It checks for invalid operators, too many operators, and too many operands. prog3.cpp is the driver file that peforms the file loading and the evaluation logic; stack.cpp contains function definitions for the user-defined Stack class; stack.h is the header file that contains the Node structure defintion and the Stack class member data.
