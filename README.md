# PostFixEvaluator
C++ Program designed to run in the LINUX terminal that evaluates postfix expressions from a text file. It also checks for invalid operators, too many operators, and too many operands in the expressions. prog3.cpp is the driver file that peforms the file loading and the evaluation logic; stack.cpp contains function definitions for the user-defined Stack class; stack.h is the header file that contains the Node structure defintion and the Stack class member data.
